    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tom Kha Gai (Thai coconut chicken soup) is perfection. It’s creamy and a
      bit tart and salty and a bit sweet, and the chicken is tender, and the
      mushrooms are filling, and the fresh cilantro adds the perfect herbaceous
      edge, and I can’t get enough of this soup. I don’t think you’d ever need
      another Whole30 Thai coconut chicken soup recipe, or heck, a plain ol’ non
      Whole30 Thai coconut chicken soup recipe for that matter, because this
      recipe is so damn good.
